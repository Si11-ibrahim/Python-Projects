Simple Neural Network Example - Step by Step
============================================

This is a simplified version to help you understand neural networks basics.
We'll create a very simple network to understand the core concepts.

Key Concepts Covered:
1. What is a neural network?
2. How do layers work?
3. Training process
4. Making predictions
